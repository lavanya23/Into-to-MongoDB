The delete operations remove the documents from the collection. MongoDB provides the following methods to delete the documents of the collection.

db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()

db.operate.deleteOne(
  { name : "Krunal Lathiya" }
)

So, it will remove the document which has the name Krunal Lathiya.

Same syntax but deleteMany function, which deletes all the documents with the provided name.

To delete documents based on certain criteria, we can use the filter operators that we used for the read and update operation:

db.users.deleteMany( { status: { $in: [ "dormant", "inactive" ] } } )
